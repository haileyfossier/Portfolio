        <h2>What I've been doing until now</h2>
        <p>Since I was able to work, the food industry has been my home. I've worked my way from busser to operations manager. Thats 15+ years of customer service skills! I love people and I love making them happy.</p>
        <p>With no climbing room left and no true desire to be there, I started looking for new career paths. During the oh so crazy COVID-19 times is when my new love for coding was found on the "Grasshoper" app. Currently I am making my way through the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. Other platforms I have introduced myself to are freeCodeCamp, Codecademy and Udemy. With that, I have watched an unlimited amount of YouTube resources and read countless Reddit posts.  </p>
